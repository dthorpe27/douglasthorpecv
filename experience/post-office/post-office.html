                September 2022 - Present</h1>
                <h1> Outline</h1>
                <ul>
                    <br><li>Working on the phone lines as the first point of contact for over 11,500 Post Office branches across the UK. </li>
                    <br><li>Liaising internally within the wider post office to provide solutions to errors made by individual branches, including working with the banking and payment teams as well as the operational support teams.</li>
                    <br><li>Understanding of the end to end processes, allowing me to aid callers with their queries in a prompt and timely manner. </li>
                    <br><li>The processes within the Post Office change rapidly, whether that’s the current physical stock available to sell, or the electronic product such as international postage being unavailable.  By keeping up to date with daily memos and weekly branch focus article sent to nationwide branches I am able to provide concise advice as soon as a change is put in place.</li>
                    <br><li>In a short period of time I have become familiar with so many of the products and processes at the Post Office, before a call comes through I am confident I will be able to help the caller. </li>
                </ul>
                <h1> Customer service</h1>
                <ul>
                    <br><li>Approaching each call in a personal, professional manner, understanding the unique needs of each of our clerks and postmasters. </li>
                    <br><li>Responding to caller’s needs with a keen focus on listening to queries before addressing the issue being reported. </li>
                    <br><li>Applying empathy to each call, respecting the individual caller’s personalities and responding with the appropriate tone and diction.</li>
                    <br><li>Relying on my understanding of both front and back office procedures to remotely guide Post Office workers through the process of both the sale of products and the rectification of errors. </li>
                    <br><li>Going above and beyond on behalf of Post Office teams, staying on the phone for as long as necessary ensuring they feel like they’re being looked after by a professional, when a solution isn’t found immediately I’m always sure to communicate with the caller to reassure them of the time scales and next steps within the process. </li>
                    <br><li>I have often gone beyond the remit of my job, from speaking to customers on behalf of postmasters to doing independant research to find the answer to a caller's question. </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <h1>Learnt Knowledge</h1>
                <ul>
                    <br><li>During my time at the Post Office I have very quickly become very knowledgeable of our catalogue of over 300 products, this allows me to provide an efficient response to callers and their query.  </li>
                    <br><li>Understanding of different time scales involved in rectifying issues with products, from refunds to customers to correction notices sent from separate departments. </li>
                    <br><li>Employing the use of our dummy Horizon kit within the web browser, I am able to work step by step through processes with clerks, having never worked in a Post Office branch it’s incredibly important for me to be able to visualise the process on behalf of the caller. </li>
                    <br><li>Applying my problem solving ability I use my knowledge of the back office systems to apply complex solutions to issues that have arisen within Post Office Branch currently seeking my guidance. </li>
                </ul>
