                    <h1>August 2013 – April 2017 – Lovehoney Ltd.:</h1> 
                        <h2>September 2015 – April 2017 Warehouse Team Leader </h2>
                        <h2>August 2013 - September 2015 Warehouse Assistant </h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>As a team leader at Lovehoney I was responsible for the day to day management of over 20 people, ensuring effective and timely delivery of warehouse services.</li>
                                <br><li>Interfacing between my immediate warehouse colleagues, external couriers, other departments within the company along with senior management, ensuring the needs of the business were effectively reflected in the service we provided. </li>
                                <br><li>My team regularly processed 5000 customer orders per day and I interacted with four different courier services each with particular processing requirements. During busier periods, volumes could reach over 15000 customer orders and such variability requires staff flexibility and correspondingly close management. </li>
                                <br><li>Managing the workload of the team by balancing resource availability and skill-sets, I ensured my team worked efficiently and regularly exceeded the daily picking/packing targets. </li>
                                <br><li>I was the escalation point for internal queries and the main point of contact for resolving issues with the distribution service. </li>
                                <br><li>Responsible for delivery of daily team meetings, motivation of the team, dispute resolution (predominantly informal , but I was also involved in formal disputes) and managing shift rota’s.</li><br>
                                <br><li><strong><em>Some of the process improvements I implemented include:</em></strong> 
                                    <ul>
                                        <br><li>Introduction of a new system of packing where labels are printed on each packing desk as an order completes. This required system changes but has increased efficiency and accuracy of order processing. </li>
                                        <br><li>Introducing and training staff to effectively use single sheet picking following digitisation of some elements of the process. </li>
                                        <br><li>Identification and implementation of a streamlined warehouse air mail process, removing the need to handle and sort 90% of the shipments which now saves the business 40 man hours per week (representing an £18,000 annual efficiency saving). </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <br><li>Recognised as having a comprehensive knowledge of the end to end warehouse process I was often asked to test new methods and processes, feeding back reports to senior management.</li>
                                <br><li>I was responsible to training new starters, personal development of staff through formal and/or on-the-job training courses, training staff in new processes or technologies. </li>
