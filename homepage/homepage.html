        <div id="personal_statement"><p> <strong>About Me:</strong><br> A mature, motivated professional with operational management and technical factory experience, 
                excellent communication skills, and a recognised ability to inspire and manage effective teams.<br><br>
                With strong IT capability backed by an exceptional customer service focus, a proven track record of delivery and a desire to drive efficiency, now seeking to take on a new and challenging role. <br><br> 
                The time I’ve spent studying web development in my free time has made me realise that it’s the professional avenue that I wish to follow, the excitement that comes from writing functional code reflects my lifelong interest in creativity and the building of something new and unique. I thrive on the opportunity to learn new skills in a practical setting and if given the chance I will be an asset to your organisation.<br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Why Me?</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>I'm a fast learner, when I'm in a new job I want to know everything there is to know about end to end processes</li><br>
                    <li>I love the concept of programming, the structure of front and back end development excites me</li><br>
                    <li>As a fresh pair of eyes to the company I can bring new idea along with being molded to the company's working practices and systems</li><br>
                    <li>I always commit to the company, in every job I've had I've thrived to be the best employee, as part of a team this attitude drives me to support my colleagues to become the best we can be</li><br>

                </ul>
                <br><strong> Keen to develop in a progressive organisation</strong><br>
